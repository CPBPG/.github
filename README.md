The Computational Physics and Biophysics Group performs theoretical calculations and computational simulations including method development on a variety of molecular systems. In order to tackle the large range of dynamical processes involved, molecular dynamics simulations, electronic structure calculations and quantum dynamical simulations are performed and often coupled.
